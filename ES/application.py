description="This program gives you the ability to spellcheck any English word, with an easy to use interface and the ability to run in the background."
quickhelp="This interface is quite different than the old version of this application. It's the same shortcut to open the main screen of the program. However, if you want to get to the available options you have to press alt, alternatively, you can open the menu, see the shortcuts, then use them from the main window instead. Without opening the menu, giving you quick access. And if you want to close the window and keep it running in the background, just hit escape from the main window. Enjoy"
