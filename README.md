# Easy-Spellchecker
A lightweight application to check the spelling of certain words on the fly. For better accuracy, use of advanced tools is required. This isn't intended for professional use and should not be taken as such.
Check requirements.txt for the modules required to run from source.
The program interface is a rather standard one, so there shouldn't be any problems utilizing it to its full extent. Furthermore, a visually presentable interface isn't guaranteed as the interface was designed solely for screen readers. This is something I put together for me and my friends and I never intended it to be anything more than that.
Any and all contributions would be appreciated.
